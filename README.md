# Overview

This repository contains the implementation of three time series forecasting models for predicting monthly revenue:

1. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
3. Facebook Prophet

These models are used to forecast future monthly revenue based on historical data. The repository includes code to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
